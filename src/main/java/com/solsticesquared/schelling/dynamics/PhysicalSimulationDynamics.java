/**
 * Represents an implementation of {@link SimulationDynamics} that describes
 * a simulation where "unhappy" agents search for new locations to move from
 * a list of empty cells and, potentially, where "happy" agents may also
 * relocate to neighborhoods that are of equal utility to their current one.
 *
 * <p>
 *     As per VinkoviÄ‡ and Kirman (2006), a simulation that allows "happy"
 *     agents to relocate as well as "unhappy" ones yields "liquid" dynamics and
 *     is continuously in motion.  In contrast, a "solid" simulation is one
 *     where only "unhappy" are allowed to move and, in general, usually
 *     grinds to a halt after a short number of iterations (assuming
 *     there is no stochastic influence in, for example, the utility
 *     function).  This "solid" phenomenon is just as pronounced in a
 *     swap-based simulation, as given by {@link SwapSimulationDynamics}.
