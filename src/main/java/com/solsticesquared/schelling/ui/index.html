        <h2>Exploration of Schelling's Model</h2>
        By Will Knez
</table>

<p>
    This project presents three popular variations of Thomas Schelling's
    (1971) work on residential segregation.  The basic premise is as
    follows: consider a grid of <i>n</i>x<i>n</i> cells, a certain percentage of
    which are vacant and the rest are divided amongst members of two groups.
    Each group has a numeric quantity, called the tolerance, that determines
    the proportion of same-group members that must be nearby in order for an
    agent of that group to consider the neighborhood satisfactory.  If there
    are too few, the agent becomes unhappy and will try to find a new
    location next round.  The three variations of these rules are:
    <ol>
      <li><b>Liquid</b> - in addition to unhappy agents that search for
          new places of residence, a "happy" agent may also elect to move
          to a location that is equally as satisfactory as her current
          location.  This allows the model to continue indefinately.</li>
      <li><b>Solid</b> - only unhappy agents may move to acceptable, vacant
          locations.  </li>
      <li><b>Swap</b> - same mechanics as the solid variation but with no
      vacant cells.  Instead, unhappy agents swap places with each
          directly.</li>
    </ol>
    Agent groups can be configured using the "Groups" tab and other parameters
    such as the neighborhood size, evaluation method, and statistics
    tracking can be found on the "Model" tab.  Finally, the "Displays" tab
    allows access to the statistics window.
